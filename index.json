Two standard ways of delivering immediate event feedback are through the use of alerts and toast messages . To avoid a lot of boilerplate markup popping up all over the project I wanted to make it as simple as just dispatching an action such as \u0026ldquo;dispatch(errorAlert('your call cannot be completed as dialed');\u0026rdquo; and have the alert appear on the screen. I am using Bootstrap for this project but the same concept should translate to other frameworks such as Ant Design , Material UI , or Foundation for Sites .\nWhat follows is a short replay of how I implemented an asynchronous alerts pipeline in my Redux template project , and one or more of the issues, and their subsequent solutions, I ran into during the process.\nImplementation # Bootstrap was added to the project via a global stylesheet:\nfile: /src/styles/global.scss @import \u0026#39;~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\u0026#39;;\nand then included along with their JavaScript plugin in the project\u0026rsquo;s startup file:\nfile: /src/index.tsx import React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import { createRoot } from \u0026#39;react-dom/client\u0026#39;; import { BrowserRouter } from \u0026#39;react-router-dom\u0026#39;; import { Provider } from \u0026#39;react-redux\u0026#39;; import \u0026#39;bootstrap\u0026#39;; import \u0026#39;./styles/global.scss\u0026#39;; import App from \u0026#39;./App\u0026#39;; import store from \u0026#39;./store\u0026#39;; createRoot(document.getElementById(\u0026#39;root\u0026#39;) as HTMLElement).render( \u0026lt;React.StrictMode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Provider store={store}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BrowserRouter\u0026gt; \u0026lt;App /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/BrowserRouter\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Provider\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/React.StrictMode\u0026gt; );\nAs we can see from their documentation there are several different styles of alert available from their framework that are powered by the addition of a custom class such as alert-success or alert-info. Typing # For this exercise I am only concerned with a specific subset of these, so I created an enumeration with an associated type that allows me to utilize their string-based names in a more type safe manner. This has an additional benefit of protecting me from any inevitable typos (i.e. btn-sucess btn-daanger etc.).\nfile: /src/@enums/AlertTypes.ts enum AlertTypes { Error = \u0026#39;danger\u0026#39;, Info = \u0026#39;info\u0026#39;, Success = \u0026#39;success\u0026#39;, Warning = \u0026#39;warning\u0026#39;, } export default AlertTypes;\nfile: /src/@types/AlertType.ts import AlertTypes from \u0026#39;../@enums/AlertTypes\u0026#39;; type AlertType = AlertTypes.Error | AlertTypes.Info | AlertTypes.Success | AlertTypes.Warning; export default AlertType;\nBefore we can begin to flesh out a slice for our alerts we need to decide the shape of the alert object that we will be placing in the store. The Bootstrap documentation shows some good examples of the kind of content you can put inside of a Bootstrap Alert, so for this first pass I am just going with the alert text, type, and an optional title:\nfile: /src/@interfaces/IAlert.ts import AlertType from \u0026#39;../@types/AlertType\u0026#39;; interface IAlert { type: AlertType; text: string; title?: string; } export default IAlert;\nSlice # For the slice I am thinking that we just need to hold and array of our IAlert shaped objects that can be picked up by a reactive component watching for changes to the store.alerts. Since we are actually adding to an array of alert messages I believe a more accurate action name should be dispatch(addErrorAlert(... as opposed to my initial thought of dispatch(errorAlert(... to better reflect how we are actually changing the store. Let\u0026rsquo;s start off with just two actions in order to assess the validity of this approach. This felt like a good first pass:\nfile: /src/store/slices/alerts.ts import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; import AlertTypes from \u0026#39;../../@enums/AlertTypes\u0026#39;; import { IStore } from \u0026#39;../\u0026#39;; const initialState: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt; = []; export const alerts = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;alerts\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { addInfoAlert: (state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { state.push({ ...action.payload, type: AlertTypes.Info, }); }, addSuccessAlert: (state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { state.push({ ...action.payload, type: AlertTypes.Success }); }, }, }); export const { addInfoAlert, addSuccessAlert } = alerts.actions; export const selectAlerts = (state: IStore) =\u0026gt; state.alerts; export default alerts.reducer;\nContainer and Alert Components # Now we just need a functional container component to watch our store for new alerts:\nfile: /src/components/app/AppAlerts/AppAlerts.tsx import React, { FC } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import { useAppSelector } from \u0026#39;../../../helpers\u0026#39;; import { selectAlerts } from \u0026#39;../../../store/slices/alerts\u0026#39;; import styles from \u0026#39;./AppAlerts.module.scss\u0026#39;; import Alert from \u0026#39;./Alert\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; const AppAlerts: FC = () =\u0026gt; { const alerts = useAppSelector(selectAlerts); return ( \u0026lt;div className={styles.wrapper}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div className={styles.alertsCol}\u0026gt; {alerts.map((alert: IAlert, index: number) =\u0026gt; ( // yes `index` is a bit greasy, but give me a minute \u0026lt;Alert key={index} alert={alert} /\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default AppAlerts;\nfile: /src/components/app/AppAlerts/Alert/Alert.tsx import React, { FC } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; export interface IAlertProps { alert: IAlert; } const Alert: FC\u0026lt;IAlertProps\u0026gt; = ({ alert }) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div className={`alert alert-${alert.type} alert-dismissible fade show d-flex align-items-center`} role=\u0026#34;alert\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {alert.title ?

The way that I have designed the actions they require the entire IAlert interface including the type. I was really hoping to abstract that implementation detail away from the developer so let\u0026rsquo;s see what can be done about that.\nThe solution was actually fairly easy. Redux Toolkit provides an optional prepare callback argument to allow you to do additional processing to the incoming action\u0026rsquo;s payload before passing it on to the actual reducer. Here I configure the action prepare method to accept a partial IAlert which we then fill in the missing AlertType field before passing the now complete IAlert to the reducer.\nfile: /src/store/slices/alerts.ts import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; import AlertTypes from \u0026#39;../../@enums/AlertTypes\u0026#39;; import { IStore } from \u0026#39;../\u0026#39;; const initialState: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt; = []; export const alerts = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;alerts\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { addInfoAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: { ...alert, type: AlertTypes.Info } }; }, }, addSuccessAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: { ...alert, type: AlertTypes.Success } }; }, }, }, }); export const { addInfoAlert, addSuccessAlert } = alerts.actions; export const selectAlerts = (state: IStore) =\u0026gt; state.alerts; export default alerts.reducer;\nFirst Test Drive # ESLint is happy and we can now fire up the app and see what damage we have done. hooray! Looks like the components are accurately reflecting the current store: current store Most of us have experienced the feeling, right? Hecks YEAH!!1! \u0026hellip;oh, a second design flaw # Let\u0026rsquo;s click the close buttons to get rid of these before we take a victory lap - but what\u0026rsquo;s this? The state still contains our alerts that we closed. why are they still there? The really bad thing is that the alerts functionality still works and will add new alerts and not display the old ones, but that still leaves state that is no longer relevant in our store. Of course this is not optimal so we need to fix it. bloated with stale information Removing Stale Messages # We need to add a unique identifier for each alert so that we can easily locate it and remove it from state via a new action. Let\u0026rsquo;s add uuid to help with this: yarn add uuid yarn add --dev @types/uuid # or if you prefer npm i uuid npm i -D @types/uuid\nAdd an id property to our alert interface:\nfile: /src/@interfaces/IAlert.ts import AlertType from \u0026#39;../@types/AlertType\u0026#39;; interface IAlert { id: string; type: AlertType; text: string; title?: string; } export default IAlert;\nWe will generate the id and add it to the alert in the action\u0026rsquo;s prepare callback. Since this is starting to add some repetitive logic let us go ahead and pull the payload preparation logic out to a helper method.\nfile: /src/store/slices/alerts.ts import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39;; import { v4 as uuid } from \u0026#39;uuid\u0026#39;; import AlertTypes from \u0026#39;../../@enums/AlertTypes\u0026#39;; import AlertType from \u0026#39;../../@types/AlertType\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; import { IStore } from \u0026#39;../\u0026#39;; const initialState: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt; = []; const createAlertPayload = (type: AlertType, alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): IAlert =\u0026gt; { return { ...alert, id: uuid(), type, }; }; export const alerts = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;alerts\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { addInfoAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: createAlertPayload(AlertTypes.Info, alert) }; }, }, addSuccessAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: createAlertPayload(AlertTypes.Success, alert) }; }, }, }, }); export const { addInfoAlert, addSuccessAlert } = alerts.actions; export const selectAlerts = (state: IStore) =\u0026gt; state.alerts; export default alerts.reducer;\nBack in the slice let\u0026rsquo;s add an action to remove a specified alert from the array.\nfile: /src/store/slices/alerts.ts import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39;; import { v4 as uuid } from \u0026#39;uuid\u0026#39;; import AlertTypes from \u0026#39;../../@enums/AlertTypes\u0026#39;; import AlertType from \u0026#39;../../@types/AlertType\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; import { IStore } from \u0026#39;../\u0026#39;; const initialState: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt; = []; const createAlertPayload = (type: AlertType, alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): IAlert =\u0026gt; { return { ...alert, id: uuid(), type, }; }; export const alerts = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;alerts\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { removeAlert: (state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { const index = state.findIndex(a =\u0026gt; a.id === action.payload); if (index \u0026gt; -1) { state.splice(index, 1); } }, addInfoAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: createAlertPayload(AlertTypes.Info, alert) }; }, }, addSuccessAlert: { reducer(state: Array\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;, action: PayloadAction\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;) { state.push(action.payload); }, prepare(alert: Partial\u0026lt;IAlert\u0026gt;): any { return { payload: createAlertPayload(AlertTypes.Success, alert) }; }, }, }, }); // don\u0026#39;t forget to export the new action export const { addInfoAlert, addSuccessAlert, removeAlert } = alerts.actions; export const selectAlerts = (state: IStore) =\u0026gt; state.alerts; export default alerts.reducer;\nNow we can fix that greasy key in the alerts container:\nfile: /src/components/app/AppAlerts/AppAlerts.tsx import React, { FC } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import { useAppSelector } from \u0026#39;../../../helpers\u0026#39;; import { selectAlerts } from \u0026#39;../../../store/slices/alerts\u0026#39;; import styles from \u0026#39;./AppAlerts.module.scss\u0026#39;; import Alert from \u0026#39;./Alert\u0026#39;; import IAlert from \u0026#39;../../../@interfaces/IAlert\u0026#39;; const AppAlerts: FC = () =\u0026gt; { const alerts = useAppSelector(selectAlerts); return ( \u0026lt;div className={styles.wrapper}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div className={styles.alertsCol}\u0026gt; {alerts.map((alert: IAlert, index: number) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;Alert key={alert.id} alert={alert} /\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default AppAlerts;\nSo now we know each alert will have its own unique identifier, and that we have an action to remove an alert object out of the state array using the identifier - the question arises where is the best place to actually dispatch the removeAlert action from? Back in the Bootstrap Alert documentation it shows a pair of events, close.bs.alert and closed.bs.alert that we could attach an event listener to. Initially I chose closed.bs.alert thinking that the component might unexpectedly disappear from the user\u0026rsquo;s screen while animations were still in progress. After running into intermittent errors I realized that I was causing errors while attempting to unbind an event listener from a div that Bootstrap had already destroyed. By switching the event listener to close.bs.alert it appears to give us enough time to unbind our listener without throwing DOMNode errors. To attach our listener to this exact alert instance we will need a reference to the div just created which we can obtain from the useRef hook.

I want to be clear up front - I find nothing wrong with Axios, it is an extremely high quality package and a natural progression having used Angular \u0026rsquo;s http service that it was originally based upon. I will likely still rely on Axios in NodeJS projects, but times change and it now seems a bit redundant in front-end client applications.\nThere are really only a few factors that are prompting me to make this change:\nThere is no longer a need for me to support legacy browsers A need to get back exactly what was being sent by the server without any additional overhead No longer seeing the necessity of such a package on the client when the native browser API is more than sufficient Before # So here is a typical, albeit contrived, previous use of Axios in a front-end service on my Redux template project :\nfile: /src/services/user/UsersApi.ts import { AxiosResponse } from \u0026#39;axios\u0026#39;; import IUser from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IUser\u0026#39;; import { getAxiosInstance } from \u0026#39;../baseService\u0026#39;; import { unwrapServiceError } from \u0026#39;../../util/service\u0026#39;; axios.defaults.baseURL = \u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/\u0026#39;; export const fetchUsers = async (): Promise\u0026lt;Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; { try { const axios = getAxiosInstance(); const response: AxiosResponse = await axios.get(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;); return response.data; } catch (e) { throw unwrapServiceError(\u0026#39;UsersApi.fetchUsers\u0026#39;, e); } };\nAlong with the factory method to create the Axios instance:\nfile: /src/services/baseService.ts import axios, { AxiosInstance, AxiosRequestConfig } from \u0026#39;axios\u0026#39;; import { config as appConfig } from \u0026#39;../config\u0026#39;; export const getAxiosInstance = (token?: string): AxiosInstance =\u0026gt; { const getConfig = (token?: string): AxiosRequestConfig =\u0026gt; { const config: AxiosRequestConfig = { baseURL: appConfig.apiUrl, headers: { \u0026#39;Cache-Control\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;no-cache\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/json\u0026#39;, Pragma: \u0026#39;no-cache\u0026#39;, }, }; if (token) { config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`; } return config; }; const config = getConfig(token); const instance = axios.create(config); // NOTE: Wire interceptors here. return instance; };\nAnd finally a utility I wrote to normalize Axios errors along with other types of framework errors:\nfile: /src/util/service.ts export const unwrapServiceError = (serviceMethod: string, error: any): AxiosError | Error =\u0026gt; { if (error.response) { // utilize more robust AxiosError const e = error as AxiosError; if (e.response!.status === HttpStatusCodes.BadRequest \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !e.response!.data?.message) { e.response!.data = e.response!.data || {}; e.response!.data.message = `${serviceMethod}: Not Found`; } return e; } return new Error(`${serviceMethod} error: ${error.message}`); };\nThis pattern and code nearly verbatim has served me well for many, many projects.\nThe Rewrite # My process for switching to the native Fetch API started with a visit to the MDN documentation pertaining to passing body, options, headers etc. to a fetch request. It was pretty obvious that it would not be too difficult of a process to create a helper method to do something similar to axios.create. I opted just to create the request body and explicitly pass it to fetch in the service so that it is clear that we are using the native API.\nfile: /src/helpers/service.ts import { ACCESS_ERROR, GENERIC_SERVICE_ERROR } from \u0026#39;../constants\u0026#39;; // for the demo this is in a `.env` file that Create-React-App is auto-wired to pick up const apiUri = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URI; function createRequest(method: FetchRequestType) { return (url: string, body?: any, token?: string): Request =\u0026gt; { const headers: Headers = new Headers({ \u0026#39;Cache-Control\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;no-cache\u0026#39;, Pragma: \u0026#39;no-cache\u0026#39;, }); if (body) { headers.append(\u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;application/json\u0026#39;); } if (token) { headers.append(\u0026#39;Authorization\u0026#39;, `Bearer ${token}`); } const init: RequestInit = { method, mode: \u0026#39;cors\u0026#39;, cache: \u0026#39;no-cache\u0026#39;, headers, }; if (token) { init.credentials = \u0026#39;include\u0026#39;; } if (body) { init.body = JSON.stringify(body); } return new Request(`${apiUri}${url}`, init); }; }\nMaybe a little more verbose, but I opted for clarity when naming my exported helper functions:\nfile: /src/helpers/service.ts export const createGetRequest = createRequest(FetchMethods.Get); export const createPatchRequest = createRequest(FetchMethods.Patch); export const createPostRequest = createRequest(FetchMethods.Post); export const createPutRequest = createRequest(FetchMethods.Put); export const createDeleteRequest = createRequest(FetchMethods.Delete);\nSince there is a lot of repetitive boilerplate around processing a fetch response I opted for another helper method and decided that it was a good place to take advantage of TypeScript\u0026rsquo;s generics for stronger typing when processing the response\u0026rsquo;s payload. Since I have run into API\u0026rsquo;s that return compound responses, similar to an AxiosResponse with the payload coming in a data field, I check for those here so I can dig the value I am looking for seamlessly out of the payload. This is probably a good spot for fine-tuning to your specific needs.\nfile: /src/helpers/service.ts export async function processApiResponse\u0026lt;Type\u0026gt;(response: Response): Promise\u0026lt;Type\u0026gt; { if (response.ok) { const payload = await response.json(); // see if we have a compound API response if (payload.status \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (payload.data || payload.errors)) { if (!payload.success) { throw payload; } return payload.data as Type; } return payload as Type; } if ( response.status === HttpStatusCodes.Unauthorized || response.status === HttpStatusCodes.Forbidden ) { throw new Error(ACCESS_ERROR); } throw new Error(GENERIC_SERVICE_ERROR); }\nAs we are no longer dealing with a potential AxiosError body the error processor gets more than a little slimmer:\nfile: /src/helpers/service.ts export const unwrapServiceError = (serviceMethod: string, error: any): Error =\u0026gt; { return new Error( `${serviceMethod} error: ${error.errors ? error.errors[0] : error.message}` ); };\nResult # Putting it all together I feel that it makes my service functions a bit more streamlined and easier to read:\nfile: /src/services/user/UsersApi.ts import IUser from \u0026#39;../../@interfaces/IUser\u0026#39;; import { createGetRequest, processApiResponse, unwrapServiceError } from \u0026#39;../../helpers\u0026#39;; export const fetchUsers = async (): Promise\u0026lt;Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; { try { const response = await fetch(createGetRequest(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;)); return await processApiResponse\u0026lt;Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(response); } catch (e) { throw unwrapServiceError(\u0026#39;UsersApi.fetchUsers\u0026#39;, e); } };\nAs always feel free to drop me a line if you see anything you feel could be improved.

However, after fully embracing TypeScript the one thing that still irritated me was a seemingly growing amount of non-JavaScript related files bloating up my project folders - ie. the superset part of TypeScript: types, interfaces, and enumerations. When I am looking at a folder with more than six (6) *.ts files it is nice to know that I am looking at app logic and/or unit tests.\nI believe the first time I noticed an at folder it was something along the lines of @models in one of the company\u0026rsquo;s architects seed projects. I thought the @ prefix was a novel idea being legal in JavaScript/TypeScript and it really called out to me that this was a special folder. At the time our stable team was working on a really interface-heavy React front-end and some of the service and component folders were growing quite large with bespoke interfaces and types mixed in with the business logic and (too few) unit tests.\nOne weekend I decided to create a spike branch and move as many of the interfaces and types as I could into @types and @interfaces folders. Not only did it declutter some service and component folders I also managed to find a couple of places we had duplicates and more than one error. This pattern proved to be very popular with the team and we expanded the idea to include an @enumerations folder to house some enumerations we had created to lend meaning to some of the magic numbers and string values peppered around the project. After a few years using this pattern I have not had a team yet that disliked, or really had any problem with it.\nSome more detail and examples of my reasoning follows.\n@enums (or @enumerations) # Here we give meaning to groups of numbers or strings, say your backend had a numeric field AddressType - what does that 1 in the field really mean? By creating an AddressTypes enumeration we no longer have to remember 3 means \u0026ldquo;Business\u0026rdquo; or that 5 stands for \u0026ldquo;Cabin by the Lake\u0026rdquo;. For a real-world example this particular enumeration helps me keep a lot of magic numbers out of my React front-ends and NodeJS backends:\n@enums/HttpStatusCodes.ts /* eslint-disable no-magic-numbers */ enum HttpStatusCodes { Ok = 200, Created, Accepted, NoContent = 204, MovedPermanently = 301, Redirect = 302, BadRequest = 400, Unauthorized, Forbidden = 403, NotFound, InternalServerError = 500, NotImplemented, BadGateway, } export default HttpStatusCodes;\n@interfaces # The majority of the interface definitions I put here describe the DTO\u0026rsquo;s coming from my services. Since I come from a C# background I like to preface all of my interface names with \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, as in IUsersResponse, IWidget, etc. - I find that it helps me differentiate interfaces at a glance from types or classes.\nexample: export default interface IUser { id: number; name: string; username: string; address: { street: string; suite: string; city: string; zipcode: string; geo: { lat: number; lng: number; }; }; phone: string; website: string; company: { name: string; catchPhrase: string; bs: string; }; }\n@types # Really just what it says, types that apply project wide. I feel the best example is a combination of an enumeration and type that I find handy when creating Redux Toolkit slices that utilize thunks:\n@types/AsyncStatus.ts import AsyncStates from \u0026#39;../@enums/AsyncStates\u0026#39;; type AsyncStatus = | AsyncStates.Idle | AsyncStates.Pending | AsyncStates.Success | AsyncStates.Fail; export default AsyncStatus;\n@enums/AsyncStates.ts enum AsyncStates { Idle = \u0026#39;IDLE\u0026#39;, Pending = \u0026#39;PENDING\u0026#39;, Success = \u0026#39;SUCCESS\u0026#39;, Fail = \u0026#39;FAIL\u0026#39;, } export default AsyncStates;\nWork together like so to better describe the intent of the values being used:\nstore/slices/user.ts import { fetchUsers } from \u0026#39;../../services/user/UsersApi\u0026#39;; // NOTE: not all interfaces end up in the global folder if they make // more sense at a granular level export interface IUserSlice { current: IUser | null; users: Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;; status: AsyncStatus; error: string | null; } export const initialState: IUserSlice = { current: null, users: [], status: AsyncStates.Idle, error: null, }; export const user = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { clearCurrentUser: (state: IUserSlice) =\u0026gt; { state.current = null; }, setCurrentUser: (state: IUserSlice, action: { type: string; payload: number }) =\u0026gt; { const user = state.users.find(x =\u0026gt; x.id === action.payload); if (user) { state.current = user; state.error = null; } else { state.current = null; state.error = \u0026#39;user not found\u0026#39;; } }, }, extraReducers: builder =\u0026gt; { builder.addCase(loadUsers.pending, (state: IUserSlice) =\u0026gt; { state.status = AsyncStates.Pending; }); builder.addCase( loadUsers.fulfilled, (state: IUserSlice, { payload }: PayloadAction\u0026lt;Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt; | undefined\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { state.status = AsyncStates.Success; state.users = payload ? (payload as Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;) : []; // or you could make it an additive operation // state.users = [...state.users, ...(action.payload as Array\u0026lt;IUser\u0026gt;)]; }, ); builder.addCase(loadUsers.rejected, (state: IUserSlice, action: any) =\u0026gt; { state.status = AsyncStates.Fail; state.error = action.payload as string; state.users = []; }); }, });\nBonus: @mocks # Since some of the response signatures from the services can be quite complex we found it convenient to collect all of our mocks in a single location to be easily reused across multiple unit tests. It is also handy for the rest of the team to not have to reinvent the wheel each time they are writing new code relating to the previously mocked values.\nAnother bonus that came out of creating these mocks is we found that it allowed us to develop service and component code in parallel with the backend. The front-end developer collaborates with the backend dev to get the proposed shape of the DTO that will come out of the API. From there it is simply a matter of defining the interface for said data and developing a mock return value in the @mocks directory. To simulate the interaction for your application you can pipe mocked values through the service code until the backend is ready for you to pull the live version. And triple-bonus you now have valid mocks for all unit tests around the service consumption.\nexample: import IBlock from \u0026#39;../@interfaces/IBlock\u0026#39;; const mockChain: Array\u0026lt;IBlock\u0026gt; = [ { timestamp: 1, lastHash: \u0026#39;-----\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;=====\u0026#39;, data: [], difficulty: 3, nonce: 0, }, { timestamp: 1664912323208, lastHash: \u0026#39;=====\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;12d331b40d8ef653827c9e43502c3ee73232038be01937f1cd8328fe699a85a8\u0026#39;, data: [\u0026#39;lookit\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;da\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;birdie\u0026#39;], difficulty: 2, nonce: 8, }, { timestamp: 1664912364866, lastHash: \u0026#39;12d331b40d8ef653827c9e43502c3ee73232038be01937f1cd8328fe699a85a8\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;458059ca76b703b0be6d7f30b80fb44ad3b8436348032f59efcf5056930b2b38\u0026#39;, data: [\u0026#39;data\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;come\u0026#39;n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;get\u0026#39;ur\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;data\u0026#39;], difficulty: 1, nonce: 1, }, { timestamp: 1664912386011, lastHash: \u0026#39;458059ca76b703b0be6d7f30b80fb44ad3b8436348032f59efcf5056930b2b38\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;15c3351282a1c3a5744e101c005243a3df0b9ce781c3a76d55f850c28fd3dbdd\u0026#39;, data: [\u0026#39;why\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;not\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;both?\u0026#39;], difficulty: 1, nonce: 2, }, { timestamp: 1664912416611, lastHash: \u0026#39;15c3351282a1c3a5744e101c005243a3df0b9ce781c3a76d55f850c28fd3dbdd\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;2f0211da93f4ef426f4588c1ba36db5cdbc6802e8ef8156494f9507af253da74\u0026#39;, data: [\u0026#39;not\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;your\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;friend\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;buddy\u0026#39;], difficulty: 1, nonce: 4, }, { timestamp: 1664912432611, lastHash: \u0026#39;2f0211da93f4ef426f4588c1ba36db5cdbc6802e8ef8156494f9507af253da74\u0026#39;, hash: \u0026#39;12e5596c6f124fc0989a2f61cc79b48b5e16a8ce5abfb43ad47d8a531c406d1f\u0026#39;, data: [\u0026#39;not\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;your\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;buddy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;amigo\u0026#39;], difficulty: 1, nonce: 1, }, ]; export default mockChain;\nin use: import mockChain from \u0026#39;../../../@mocks/blockchain\u0026#39;; import * as chainApi from \u0026#39;../../services/ChainApi\u0026#39;; jest.mock(\u0026#39;../../services/ChainApi\u0026#39;); describe(\u0026#39;components / App\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { it(\u0026#39;should match the snapshot\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { (chainApi.fetchBlocks as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce(mockChain); const component = render(\u0026lt;App /\u0026gt;); expect(component.container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot(); }); });\nWhich may also be easily reused in the negative test:\n// just making something up here as the BlockChain class // itself actually prevents tampered chains const badChain = [...mockChain]; badChain[1].lastHash = \u0026#39;1am4b4dh4xx0r\u0026#39;; (chainApi.fetchBlocks as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce(badChain); I hope that maybe this can help some of you reduce the cognitive load of your larger TypeScript projects.

Note: As far as I can tell Create React App powered projects will not recognize Jest settings outside of the package.json, but here is a working example from one of my NodeJS projects:\njest.config.js module.exports = { testRegex: \u0026#39;.*\\\\.test\\\\.tsx?$\u0026#39;, transform: { \u0026#39;^.+\\\\.(t|j)sx?$\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;ts-jest\u0026#39;, }, setupFilesAfterEnv: [\u0026#39;./setupTests.ts\u0026#39;], collectCoverage: true, collectCoverageFrom: [ \u0026#39;**/*.{js,ts,tsx}\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!src/api/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!coverage/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!data-scripts/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!node_modules/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/@enums/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/@interfaces/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/@mocks/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/@types/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/**/index.ts\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!**/**.d.ts\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!src/client/index.tsx\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!src/client/services/**\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!scripts/average-work.ts\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!jest.config.js\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;!setupTests.ts\u0026#39;, ], coverageThreshold: { global: { branches: 85, functions: 95, statements: 85, }, }, };\nSo any time I find a new section of key-value pairs that I do not think belong in the package.json I consult the documentation to see if an option exists to move it out into a separate file. For me, personally, having my project configuration more focused into digestible chunks is worth the minor expense of afew extra files in my project root.\na fairly average project root ","date":"7 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/psa-clean-up-package-json/","section":"Posts","summary":"I have a minor peeve, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just me, but I really dislike random chunks of configuration cluttering up my package.json file.

If you have a question feel free to reach out to me directly via the contact information I have provided here.\nIf you find anything of use in my random stuff - glad that I could be of service.\nHave a great day!\n","date":"5 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/hi/","section":"Posts","summary":"Just wanted to say \u0026ldquo;Hi\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Thank you\u0026rdquo; for stopping by.\nIf you are curious I am planning this site as more of place for me to keep notes on new things I learn or figure out in a more searchable format than a bunch of random projects on one of my dev boxes.","title":"Hi"},{"content":"","date":"5 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/irrelevant-drivel/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Irrelevant Drivel"}]
