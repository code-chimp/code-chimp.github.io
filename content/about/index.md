## What I do

I have been shipping code for well over two decades now, and I still really love my work.  Currently I am working as a
front-end heavy full-stack developer - being a huge fan of the [React][react] framework and having decades worth of
experience with the [.NET ecosystem][dn]. I have entirely embraced [TypeScript][ts] for anything I would normally have
written in JavaScript - such as a React front-end, [NodeJS][nodejs] middle tier code, or even [personal experiments][rnx]
with [React Native][rn]. Lately I have been focusing on automating my code quality through the use of good static
analysis tools like [ESLint][esl] and [Prettier][pret] paired with an extensive test suite - usually leveraging
[Kent C. Dodd's][kcd] excellent [Testing Library][testl] to enhance the [Jest][jest] testing framework
[(example)][mycrypto].

## How I got here

{{< figure src="my_bookshelf.jpg" alt="my bookshelf" caption="the books in the middle opened a new world for me" >}}

I was bitten by the programming bug after seeing the Disney movie [Tron][tron] as a young teenager - afterwards
ceaselessly bugging my parents until they gave in and purchased a top-of-the line Apple //c for me.
That computer introduced me to the world of Apple Basic and 6502 Assembler and still sits in a corner of my office
[(pic)]({{< ref "#my-apple-c" >}} "The original Apple //c").

After years of developing in mainframe languages and Visual Basic 6 I finally slid into web development with the first
release of ASP.NET. Fast forward a bit and I land at a startup as a "C# Cloud Developer", but since I proved to be really
handy with jQuery, HTML5 and this new-fangled thing called [Sass][sass] I was tasked with being the "front-end guy". I
very quickly learned that I loved the bleeding edge of 2013 front-end development - evaluating frameworks like early
[AngularJS][ng], [Backbone][bb], and [Knockout][ko] tooling like the [Grunt][grunt] and [Gulp][gulp] task runners and an
early bundler called [Almond][almond]. The rest, as they say, is history as the frameworks, tooling, and discipline of
front-end development have only grown more refined since then.

## Where I am

I live in Omaha, NE with my wife, daughter and three very random rescue dogs. Even though I am not wild about winters
here in the Midwest, I cannot seem to talk my wife into moving anywhere else so I am stuck here for the time being. In
my spare time I like experimenting with different programming languages and frameworks. When my family manages to get me
out of the house I enjoy walking our local [botanical gardens][laur], [world class zoo][hdz], or one of [our many][dur] -
[sometimes eclectic][shd] - [museums][jos].
