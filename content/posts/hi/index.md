Just wanted to say **"Hi"** and **"Thank you"** for stopping by.

If you are curious I am planning this site as more of place for me to keep notes on new things I learn or figure out in
a more searchable format than a bunch of random projects on one of my dev boxes. Thanks to the
<abbr title="Attention deficit disorder">ADD</abbr> and the excellent marketing departments of places like
[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/), [Manning](https://www.manning.com/), and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
I always have a backlog of shiny new things that I am teaching myself and it has started to become a challenge when
attempting to recall "what project did I put that cool piece of code in that did that thing I want to do now?".

If you find anything of use in my random stuff - glad that I could be of service.

Have a great day!
